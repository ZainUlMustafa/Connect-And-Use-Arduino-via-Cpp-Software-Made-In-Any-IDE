### DISCLAMER:

This Serial code is now maintained by me but as perviously the code is open-source. Do whatever you want with it. Yippie! 

~~This Serial library is not created by me, however, the code written to use this library is written by me. This is an open-source library and code so use, merge, or distribute it anywhere you want without any permissions required.~~
